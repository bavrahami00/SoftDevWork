    <h1>A Quick Guide to LaTeX</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>What is LaTeX?</h3>
    <p>It is a text formatter - something that takes in plaintext and spits out a pdf formatted with
      the commands that <b>you</b> give it. What commands? We'll get to that in a minute, but
      they're there to make life easier. LaTeX is WYSIWYM - What You See Is What You Mean - so you don't
       have to worry about the proper spacing or font or line breaks (if you give it the proper commands); it'll take of that for you.</p>
    <p> Although revolutionary when first produced, in 1984, word processors such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word
      have caught up to it in the intervening years, so that it is no longer quite as useful as it once was, but there is one place where
      it is still an industry standard: mathematics. Since math has so many symbols and subscripts and superscripts, LaTeX is still used to write
      almost all papers. On arxiv.org, a scholarly archive, roughly 97% of all mathematical papers were written with LaTeX. And in addition,
      it has that lovely font, so you can use it even if it provides no other upgrade.</p>

    <h3>How to install LaTeX</h3>
    <p>On Linux, this can be done directly from the terminal: sudo apt install texlive</p>
    <p>On Mac or Windows, this can be done by downloading the MiKTeX package.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are also specialized editors that can be used for LaTeX such as TeXMaker or TeXStudio, but since LaTeX takes in plaintext,
      as previously mentioned, it can be done in ordinary text editors such as nano.</p>
    <p>All LaTeX articles have the ending .tex, and then are converted to pdf either by a button on an editor, or by the commmand pdflatex &ltfilename&gt,
      which then can be opened with your favorite pdf viewer.</p>

    <h3>So how does LateX work?</h3>
