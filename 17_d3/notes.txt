Let's Make a Bar Chart:
<selection>.node() returns the first element in the selection, if any

d => `${d * 10}px` - This is a function that takes in d, and returns 10d pixels.
Are the brackets like parentheses, to guide order of operations?
What are the ` and $ doing? Best guess - `` creates a quote, like '' or "", because CSS needs the styling in quotes, and the $ is to break out of it and make the next character an actual number, not a quoted number

What is the difference between .create(<tag>) and .append(<tag>)?

x = f(n) appears necessary(?) before making x some mathematical function like scaleLinear()
x(n) returns the "y-value" at some input n


By Example:
Does the with clause not work with normal JavaScript? What should be used then instead?

The order seems messed up in the importing for the histogram. It appears as 'import {chart as <chartname>} with {<dataname> as data} from "@d3/histogram"'

In the with clause, there can be further specifications other than the data, if previously specified.
The clause would then be 'with {<dataname> as data,<other specifications>}
However, the other specifications must be acceptable and previously instantiated variables, such as height or width.

I don't think margin and width were used at all before the import statement in chart3, so how can they be used?
How do you know what to call in the first bracketed statement rather than the second, if you can use both?
Does the order of the specifications matter?
