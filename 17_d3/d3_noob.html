<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

    Entering the following commands via console will 
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...
    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
    /*
    	returns undefined
	data is now initialized to an array containing the given values
    */
    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");
    /*
    	returns undefined
	chart is now initialized to an Object that represents the div with the id "chart"
    */
    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");
    /* 
    	returns undefined
	bar is now initialized to an Object that contains a NodeList (currently empty because there are currently no "div"s in the HTML inside .chart)
    */
    (this defines selection to which you will join data)
    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);
    /*
    	returns undefined
	barUpdate is initialized to an Object that contains an array of Objects, each with one of the elements of data
	There is another array, called _groups, that has each joined pair. But since bar was empty (there were no "div" tags in .chart), there are no joined pairs, and thus _groups is empty.
	What .enter() will do (next command) is to create enough elements in the DOM (i.e. make the length of bar equal to the length of data) so that there can be a full complement of pairs.
	Question: What if there are more elements in bar than data, rather than the other way around? Will .enter() still match them up?
    */
    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");
    /*
    	returns undefined
	there are blue bars visible whose count corresponds to the length of data. These bars stretch the whole screen.
	barEnter is initialized to an Object that contains an array, containing divs, with each div having a __data__ property that corresponds to one of the elements of data
	barUpdate seems unchanged
	This is equivalent to var barEnter = barUpdate.enter(); barEnter = barEnter.append("div");
	The first part creates 6 new spaces in the DOM, each with their specific piece of data (the element in the array). But because it has no HTML associated with it nothing happens.
	The second part creates a <div></div> tag in each new space of the DOM, which then gets styled according to the CSS. The data is still not used, so they do not affect it yet.
    */
    //use var barEnter = barUpdate.join("div") instead
    =========================================================
    //Transitions:
    	barEnter.transition()
	  .duration(1000)
	  .style("width", d => `${d}0px`)
	  .text(d => d)
    /* takes care of both the width and the text. */
    /* Q: Is duration measured in milliseconds? */
    =========================================================
    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });
    /*
    	returns an Object containing the divs that are the bars
	the divs in barEnter are updated
	the width of the divs are changed to match the data
    */
    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });
    /*
    	returns an Object containing the divs that are the bars
	the divs in barEnter are updated
	the bars now contain text that displays their data
    */
